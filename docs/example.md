### Example

A full featured example showing most of fish-pepper's possibilities
can be found in the [example](example/) directory which holds one configuration
for building a [agent-bond](https://github.com/fabric8io/agent-bond)
enabled Java image. The build it quite similar and we will build for
OpenJDK 7 and 8 with a JDK and JRE, respectively.

All the configuration files are documented, so please have a look a
them to see how the tepmplating works.
